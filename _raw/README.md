Source code for the entire OurBigBook Project:

- [OurBigBook.com](https://OurBigBook.com)
- [`ourbigbook` CLI](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-cli)
- [Visual Studio Code extension](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#visual-studio-code)

OurBigBook is a powerful static wiki generator and lightweight markup language to write complex structured wikis/books/blogs.

The same markup source code can also be uploaded to [OurBigBook.com](https://OurBigBook.com) which has the amazing ["Topics" multi-user mind-melding magic feature](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-web-topics) ðŸ§™

A rendered version of it can be seen at: <https://docs.ourbigbook.com>. The source file for the homepage is: [index.bigb](index.bigb).

[Get started quickly with the OurBigBook command line utility](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-cli-quick-start) by using our template project <https://github.com/ourbigbook/template>:

```
git clone https://github.com/ourbigbook/template
cd template
npm install
npx ourbigbook .
firefox _out/html/index.html
firefox _out/html/not-index.html
```

The generated HTML is published at: https://ourbigbook.github.io/template

A full blown **showcase knowledge base** can be seen at:
